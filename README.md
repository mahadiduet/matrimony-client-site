Project Concept:
The main objective of this project is to find suitable spouses. Here a groom or bride gives information about category, educational qualification, communication medium, partner preference etc. There are two types of users on this website, general users and admin users. General user can see all information of one except contract information, but general user can request to admin for contract information. If a partner likes his ID, he can add it to his ID as a favorite. If a user requests for the contract number of his/her favorite bride or groom, he/she has to pay. General user can update his biodata. You can always see your request contract and favorite ID from your panel. Admin user can see all information of any ID. Super MD can grant admin role to any general user. Any general user who wants to premium his bio can request, if admin allows his ID will become premium.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
